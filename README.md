## Introduction

Welcome to the "Molecular EPISTOP" repository. In adherence to the principles of open science, we aim to maintain transparency and ensure the reproducibility of our research by sharing the code with fellow researchers.

## Paper Reference

The code in this repository was utilized to generate statistical analyses presented in the paper titled "Molecular EPISTOP, Comprehensive Multi-omic Analysis of Blood from Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Infants Age Birth to Two Years." authored by Kwiatkowski et al.

## Structure of the Repository

This repository is organized into different directories, each serving a distinct purpose. Brief descriptions of the directories are provided below:

- `/univariate_analysis`: hosts principal analysis and data collected during the "EPISTOP" project.
- `/models`: contains code designed to build and evaluate predictive models based upon omics data generated in EPISTOP.
